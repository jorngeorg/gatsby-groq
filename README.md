# Gatsby Groq (WIP)

**This is a WIP which for now includes a starter theme with local plugin for development purposes. Once ironed out it will be its own standalone plugin and these docs will be less abysmal**

To do: Purpose of plugin (groq > graphql)

## ðŸŽ‚ Features
- Replicates Gatsby's beloved patterns
- Page queries with HMR
- Static queries with live reloads
- Leverages GROQ's native functionality for advanced querying, node/document projections, joins (limited), etc.
- String interpolation (solving fragment issues)
- GROQ explorer in browser during development at `locahost:8000/__groq` **(TO DO)**
- Optimized for incremental builds on Cloud and OSS **(TO DO)**



## ðŸ§™ How it works
This plugin mimics Gatsby's own method of extracting queries from components by using Babel's tools to parse files and traverse code to capture all queries found in files. By leveraging Gatsby's Node APIs and helpers we are able to extract queries from files on demand then run them against all GraphQL nodes found in Gatsby's redux store. After queries are run we can either feed results into a page's context (page queries), or cache for later use within individual components (static queries).

For now, all cache related to groq queries can be found in `.cache/groq` during development and `public/static/groq` in production. **Note: I have made some changes since last testing builds so they might be buggy**

###  Page Queries
All page-level components with `groqQuery` exports will have their queries extracted and cached unprocessed as a hashed json file in the groq directory. The hash is based on the component's file path so it can always be associated with the page component. During bootstrap, whenever a page is created via `createPage` the plugin checks the cache to see if there is a page query related to its component. If there is, it then runs the query and replaces any variables within the query with values supplied in the page's context. The result will stored as the `data` property within `pageContext`.

For example, if a page query contains `*[ _type == "page" && _id == $_id ]{ ... }` and a page is created with `context: { _id: "123" }`, the plugin will include the variable and run the query: `*[ _type == "page" && _id == "123" ]{ ... }`.

During development all files are watched for changes, and whenever there is a change to a file containing a page query the above process runs again and the updated data is injected into all paths that contain the changed component.

### Static Queries
All components using the hook `useGroqQuery` first have these queries extracted, processed, and cached during bootstrap similar to page queries. However unlike page queries, static query hashes are based off of the queries themselves and contain the results of their queries. If a static query changes, it generates a new hashed result. During SSR and runtime, the `useGroqQuery` function then retrieves the cache associated to its query and returns the result.

Similar to page queries, all files are watched for changes and whenever there is a change to a file containing a static query the above process runs again, the query results are cached, and the page refreshes with the static query now returning the updated content.



**I think that covers most of it. Check the comments within code for more details...**



## âŒ› TO DO (random order)
- Get rid of relative directories
- Work on issues with joins
- Clean up spotty caching issues after running development
- Error messaging (especially when there are parsing errors)
- Performance optimizations
- Make docs less abysmal
- Allow for variables within static queries?
- Tests
- Proselytize everyone from GraphQL to Groq.
